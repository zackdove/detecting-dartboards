# Detecting Dartboards

## Image Processing & Computer Vision project.

In this project we will be exploring, implementing and analysing image processing and computer visio techniques in the context of identifying dartboards in images. We will experiment with the Viola-Jones object detection framework, and combine with other techniques to improve efficiacy. Working in C++ and OpenCV. We also implemented a deep neural network.

See [here](https://github.com/zackdove/detecting-dartboards/blob/master/report/darts_report.pdf) for the results and final report.

Running the detector

compile with "g++ main.cpp /usr/lib64/libopencv_core.so.2.4  /usr/lib64/libopencv_highgui.so.2.4  /usr/lib64/libopencv_imgproc.so.2.4  /usr/lib64/libopencv_objdetect.so.2.4 -std=c++11"

run with a.out "image number"
